## [Introduction](https://x-cmd.com)

1. Supports one-click execution of hosted scripts in the posixcompatible shells (**ash/bash/dash/zsh**, with more to be supported in the future), even innon-scratch lightweight container images such as busybox and alpine.
2. Supports installation of programming language runtimes (currently supports **node, python, java**, etc.), allowing users to execute hosted scripts with oneclick on environments with x environment.
3. Enhances the user experience of posix shell with themes, quickpath navigation, and better shell intelligent completion and prompting features to be added in the future.
4. Provides a range of interactive CLI tools (gh for github, gt for gitee, with more tool modules to be released in the next six months).
5. Extremely light and fast: the size of the full-featured moduleinstallation package does not exceed 1.1MB, and the shell loadingtime after initial startup generally does not exceed 100ms.

Now there are more than **210** [modules](https://x-cmd.com/mod), **more than 520** [packages](https://x-cmd.com/pkg), and **more than 1200** [install](https://www.x-cmd.com/install/) receipes ~
